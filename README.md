# A2: Show Tracker — React Edition

**Live demo:** https://a4-ezrabarb.glitch.me

This is a React‐based re-implementation of A2’s “Show Tracker.”  
I broke the UI into three reusable components—  
• **ShowTable** for displaying full/liked/disliked lists  
• **AddShowForm** for adding new entries  
• **EditShowForm** for rating updates and deletion  

I refactored my A2 Show Tracker into a React app with reusable components and React state. React’s instant rendering and automatic updates made development smoother. It was a bit tricky at first, but now I know React will be a useful tool going forward.
